                any and all activities that occur under Subscriber’s account.
                Subscriber must immediately notify Taskspring at
                info@taskspring.net of any change in authorization, any
                unauthorized use of your account or username, or other
                account-related security breach of which you are aware.
                Taskspring shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising
                from the failure of any user to keep your password or account
                secure.
                <br />
                <br />
                5. Authorized User Access. Subscriber is responsible for all
                Authorized User communications:
                <br />
                <br />
                5.1 Policy and Practices: Establishing and communicating
                Subscriber’s policy and practices regarding Authorized Users'
                access and utilization of the Services, including the use and
                dissemination of unique URLs generated by Taskspring. This
                includes, but is not limited to, notice that Authorized Users
                should not share URLs with any third party.
                <br />
                5.2 Disabling Authorized User Accounts: If an Authorized User is
                no longer employed by Subscriber or is no longer eligible to
                access the Services, Subscriber must disable the Authorized User
                on Subscriber’s team member page to ensure communications are no
                longer sent. Until Subscriber disables an Authorized User,
                Authorized Users will continue to receive team-related
                communications through the Service.
                <br />
                <br />
                6. Use Restrictions. Subscriber will not, directly or
                indirectly, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or
                otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or
                underlying structure, ideas, know-how, or algorithms relevant to
                the Services or any software, documentation, or data related to
                the Services. Subscriber will not make the Services available
                for the benefit of any third party, or sell, resell, license,
                sublicense, distribute, rent, or lease the Services to any third
                party for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.
                <br />
                <br />
                7. End User License Agreement. Taskspring hereby grants
                Subscriber a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable,

                Subscription Term to access and utilize the Services pursuant to
                the terms of the Subscription Plan purchased by Subscriber.
                Unless otherwise stated herein, nothing in this Agreement or use
                of the Application and Services gives Subscriber or its
                Authorized Users a right or license to use any of Taskspring’s
                copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos,
                domain names, or any other intellectual property rights.

                <br />
                8. Service Data Ownership. Taskspring expends significant
                resources gathering, assembling, and compiling the Service Data,
                and such Service Data constitutes an original compilation
                protected by Indonesian copyright laws. Taskspring shall retain
                all right, title, and interest in any Service Data created,
                generated, and/or derived from your use of the Services.
                Taskspring shall retain the unrestricted right, in its sole and
                absolute discretion, to utilize such Service Data for any
                purpose whatsoever, both commercial and non-commercial, without
                compensation or accounting to you. If Taskspring does not
                automatically own any Service Data upon its creation, you hereby
                assign all right, title, and interest in and to such Service
                Data to Taskspring.
                <br />
                <br />
                9. Subscriber Data License. Subscriber hereby grants to
                Taskspring a non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicensable,
                irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to
                collect, process, store, host, copy, transmit, display,
                distribute, disseminate, modify, and create derivative works of
                any and all Subscriber Data for (a) the purposes of providing
                the Services, and (b) to perform analytics or other statistical
                or benchmark analysis on anonymized Service Data at the
                aggregate level.
                <br />
                <br />
                10. Trademark/Logo License. Subscriber grants to Taskspring a
                license to use Subscriber’s company name, logo, and/or relevant
                trademarks ("Properties") (a) to market and promote the
                Services, and/or (b) upon Subscriber’s request, to customize
                Subscriber’s dashboard or Service-related communications to
                Authorized Users with its own company names and applicable
                logos. This includes the worldwide right to copy, translate,
